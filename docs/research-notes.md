# Research notes

Original pass (below, "v1") was built from AI-summarized doc excerpts. **v2 (this update)** is
sourced directly from the raw OpenAPI specs, downloaded from the developer portal:

- Payment API: `https://docs.bancontactpro.com/_bundle/apis/merchant-payment.openapi.json` — v3.6.5
- Refund API: `https://docs.bancontactpro.com/_bundle/apis/refund-public.openapi.json` — v3.0.3
- Reconciliation API: `https://docs.bancontactpro.com/_bundle/apis/merchant-reconciliation.openapi.json` — v3.0.1

Servers: `https://merchant.api.preprod.bancontact.net` (PREPROD), `https://merchant.api.bancontact.net` (PROD) — same servers for all three APIs.

This section resolves the open questions from v1 and corrects a few wrong assumptions. Anything
not explicitly called out below as corrected still stands from v1.

## Resolved: request signing header

**One real answer for all three APIs: the HTTP header is literally `Signature`.**

`JWS-Request-Signature-Payment` / `JWS-Request-Signature-Refund` / `JWS-Request-Signature` are
just the **OpenAPI security scheme names** in each spec's `components.securitySchemes` — not
header names. All three schemes declare `"name": "Signature", "in": "header", "type": "apiKey"`.
The v1 notes conflated the scheme name with the header name; there was never a real
per-API-family header difference.

Bearer API key is a **separate** header/scheme (`Authorization`, scheme `api_key_payment_profile`
— only present on the Payment API spec; Refund/Reconciliation specs only declare the signature
scheme). *Corrected 2026-10-15:* the API key is not "required on every call regardless" — see
the next section.

## Corrected (2026-10-15): which calls need a signature

Rechecked against `merchant-payment` 3.6.5, `refund-public` 3.0.3 and
`merchant-reconciliation` 3.0.1. Per operation:

| API | `security` in the spec | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Payment (create, `/pos`, get, cancel, search, acknowledge, refund IBAN) | `[{api_key_payment_profile}, {JWS-Request-Signature-Payment}]` | API key **or** signature |
| Payment `POST /callback` (Bancontact → merchant) | `[{JWS-Request-Signature-Payment}]` | Bancontact's signature, verified via its JWKS |
| Refund (create, get) | `[{JWS-Request-Signature-Refund}]` | Signature only |
| Reconciliation (payouts, payments, refunds) | `[{JWS-Request-Signature}]` | Signature only |

In OpenAPI, separate objects in a `security` list are **alternatives**; requiring both would be a
single object, `[{api_key_payment_profile: [], JWS-Request-Signature-Payment: []}]`. The earlier
reading below ("requires both") was wrong, and the library was built on it: every Payment call
was signed and the signing key was mandatory. Since this correction the Payment client sends
only the bearer API key, and the signing key is optional, needed only for Refund and
Reconciliation.

The guides agree: the getting-started guide says all requests are authenticated with API keys
(pre-production issues a PPID and an API key per integration type, so one pair per product
type), and the Refunds guide says `getRefundIban` is called with an API key while `createRefund`
"requires a JSON Web Signature (JWS)" and must be activated by Bancontact's support team. The
getting-started guide's onboarding list also mentions "a unique API key and/or JWS key"; nothing
in the specs has Bancontact issue a private key, so that phrase is unresolved. Ask devsupport if
one arrives.

**Confirmed on preprod (2026-10-15): `Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}` works.** The OpenAPI scheme
describes "Bearer authentication with API Key"; the product guides' curl examples send the bare key
(`Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`). A real `POST /v3/payments` with the library's `Bearer` header
created a payment. There is no token step: the API key *is* the bearer value (no OAuth or token
endpoint exists in any of the three specs). Whether the bare key is also accepted is untested.

**Observed on preprod (2026-10-15):**

- An unknown API key gets a 401 whose body is *not* the documented `{code, message}` shape but a
  gateway error: `{"timestamp", "path", "status": 401, "error": "Unauthorized", "requestId"}`.
  The library keeps such bodies verbatim in `BancontactApiException.Message`.
- The PPID and the API key look alike (both short random strings). A swapped pair is the first
  thing to check on a 401: the create-payment response echoes the PPID as `creditor.profileId`.
- A per-payment `callbackUrl` is accepted and echoed in `creditor.callbackUrl`.
- Preprod payment links use other hosts than production: `_links.deeplink` is on
  `pay.acc.bancontact.net` and `_links.qrcode` on `qrcodegenerator.api.preprod.bancontact.net`.
  `PaymentLinkBuilder` now builds these hosts for `Preprod` (it used to build the production
  ones regardless). See "Preprod hosts for self-built payload URLs" below.
- Timestamps come with microseconds and a `+00:00` offset (`2026-10-15T21:34:07.729375+00:00`),
  not the `.sssZ` the spec shows; `DateTimeOffset` parses both.

**Also confirmed by the guides (2026-10-15):** optional request fields are optional, not nullable
(`currency` "defaults to EUR", URLs "default to the one set in the profile"), so the library
leaves unset fields out of the JSON instead of sending `null`. Only On a Display and Static QR
create payments through the API; On a Receipt, Top Up and Invoice are QR payload URLs built locally
(see getting-started.md, "Which product uses which call").

Signature computation (identical across all three specs):

```text
jws = base64url(JOSE Header) + "." + ES256(base64url(JOSE Header) + "." + base64url(Body))
```

(detached JWS per RFC 7797 — body isn't embedded in the compact serialization, but is signed over as `base64url(header).base64url(body)`)

JOSE header:

```json
{
  "typ": "jose+json",
  "kid": "<JWK kid>",
  "alg": "ES256",
  "https://payconiq.com/sub": "{merchantProfileId}",
  "https://payconiq.com/iss": "Payconiq",
  "https://payconiq.com/iat": "{ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, e.g. 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z}",
  "https://payconiq.com/jti": "{unique request id}",
  "https://payconiq.com/path": "{request path, e.g. /v3/payments/{payment-id}}",
  "crit": ["https://payconiq.com/sub", "https://payconiq.com/iss", "https://payconiq.com/iat", "https://payconiq.com/jti", "https://payconiq.com/path"]
}
```

**One odd inconsistency preserved as-is from the spec, not resolved**: the Reconciliation API's
scheme description sets `iss` to `"{Merchant Id}"` (templated — implies the merchant's own ID),
while Payment and Refund both hardcode `iss: "Payconiq"` literally. Possibly a copy/paste error
in the reconciliation spec's prose description (it's describing the same claim set almost
verbatim otherwise). Worth a clarifying question to devsupport before finalizing the signing code, since
getting `iss` wrong would make every signature invalid.

The Payment spec's scheme description also literally says "signature of **response** payload"
and "JWS Payload MUST be the same as **response** body" (Refund/Reconciliation both say
**request**). This makes sense once you see it's reused for the `/callback` operation too (see
below) — but double-check this isn't a real distinction before assuming it's copy/paste.

**Signing direction is genuinely bidirectional and confirmed at the operation level**: every
merchant→Bancontact Payment call lists `[api_key_payment_profile, JWS-Request-Signature-Payment]`
(*corrected 2026-10-15: as alternatives, either one, not both — see "Corrected: which calls
need a signature" above*). The inbound `POST /callback` (Bancontact→merchant) requires
`[JWS-Request-Signature-Payment]` **alone** (no API key — makes sense, it's not the merchant
authenticating to Bancontact, it's Bancontact signing what it sends). Same header name
(`Signature`) both directions; different keys (merchant's key when merchant signs a request,
Bancontact's key — verified via JWKS — when Bancontact signs a callback).

**Also per the Refund/Reconciliation scheme descriptions**: the merchant/partner must host its
own public key as JWKS and share the URL with Bancontact during integration — confirms the
"two-directional JWKS" infrastructure requirement flagged in v1.

## Resolved: payment status vocabulary — it's one enum, not two

v1 flagged a *possible* split between a "payment resource" vocabulary and a "webhook event"
vocabulary. **Resolved: there is exactly one canonical enum** (`merchant-payment-status`), used
identically in the payment resource, the search response, and the webhook callback body:

```
PENDING, IDENTIFIED, AUTHORIZED, AUTHORIZATION_FAILED, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED,
PENDING_MERCHANT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, VOIDED
```

(Note the correct spelling is `PENDING_MERCHANT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` — a prose guide page had it as
`..._AKNOWLEDGMENT`, but the literal spec enum is `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT`.)

Per-status meaning, from the spec description:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Payment created, awaiting identify step |
| `IDENTIFIED` | User scanned the QR / opened in-app |
| `AUTHORIZED` | User confirmed, bank authorized |
| `AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` | Bank-side authorization failed (final) |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Completed (final) |
| `FAILED` | Something else went wrong (final) |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled by user or merchant (final) |
| `EXPIRED` | Not completed in time (final) |
| `PENDING_MERCHANT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` | Awaiting merchant ack, VOID-mode flow only |
| `VOIDED` | Cancelled after consumer confirmation, VOID-mode flow only (final) |

Note also: the create-payment response's `status` field is typed as an enum containing only
`PENDING` (i.e. it's always `PENDING` right after creation, modeled as a distinct one-value enum
in the spec rather than reusing the full enum) — same pattern on the refund side (see below).

## Corrected: the Payment API surface is bigger than first assumed

the first plan assumed 4 operations (create/get/list/cancel) with list as `GET /v3/payments`. The
**real spec has 8 operations**, and there is no plain list-all endpoint:

| Method | Path | operationId | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v3/payments` | `create` | Create payment. Only `amount` (cents, int64, 1–999,999,999,999) is required. Optional: `reference` (≤35 chars), `bulkId` (≤35), `description` (≤140), `identifyCallbackUrl`, `callbackUrl`, `returnUrl` (all HTTPS URLs, ≤2048 chars, regex-validated), `voucherEligibility` (**deprecated**, don't implement). All three URLs fall back to profile-level defaults if omitted — **none are actually hard-required at the request level**, contrary to v1's assumption. `currency` is technically a field but the enum only has one value (`EUR`, defaulted) — could be omitted from the public API surface or kept for forward-compat; your call. |
| `GET` | `/v3/payments/{id}` | `merchant-get-payment` | Get by id — the polling fallback. |
| `DELETE` | `/v3/payments/{id}` | `cancel_payment` | Cancel — 204 on success. |
| `POST` | `/v3/payments/search` | `search` | **This is "list", not a GET.** Body: `{ from, to (date-time, from defaults to yesterday), paymentStatuses[] (enum array), reference }` — all optional filters. Paginated response (`AbstractListResponsePayment` + `details[]` of full payment objects). |
| `POST` | `/v3/payments/{id}/acknowledge` | `merchant-acknowledge` | Undocumented in v1 entirely. For the VOID-mode flow (`PENDING_MERCHANT_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` status) — merchant confirms back. Body: `{ currency, amount, reference }`, both `currency`/`amount` required. |
| `GET` | `/v3/payments/{id}/debtor/refundIban` | `create-refund` *(misleading operationId — it's a GET)* | Returns the debtor's **unmasked** IBAN for issuing a refund. Response: `{ iban }`. This lives in the Payment spec, not the Refund spec, despite the name — needs the payment client, conceptually feeds the refund flow. |
| `POST` | `/v3/payments/pos` | `create_static_qr_payment` | Undocumented in v1. Creates a **static QR** payment (in-person, POS-style) — a different product line than the online checkout flow the first plan was scoped around. Worth a scoping decision: in-scope for this wrapper, or explicitly out of scope since research-notes' original framing was "genuine online/e-commerce flow ... not just the in-person QR products"? |

Since the whole point of this library is to wrap what the API exposes rather than a
curated subset, the plan should be updated to cover all of these (or `/pos` explicitly
deferred with a documented reason) rather than just create/get/search/cancel.

## Corrected: the QR code URL is a distinct `_links.qrcode`, not `_links.self`

the first plan assumed `_links.self.href` doubles as the QR code URL. **The spec has both, as
separate link relations** on the `links` object:

- `self` — the payment resource URL (for polling — not a QR code)
- `qrcode` — the actual QR code image URL, e.g. `https://qrcodegenerator.api.bancontact.net/qrcode?c=...` (accepts `f=SVG|PNG`, `s=S|M|L|XL` per v1 — not restated in the schema itself, comes from the getting-started guide)
- `deeplink` — mobile deep link (`https://payconiq.com/pay/2/{id}`)
- `checkout` — hosted checkout page URL (present on create; example shows `?paymentId=...&timestamp=...&token=...` query params)
- `cancel` — only present while cancellable
- `refund` — only present once succeeded

Only `self`, `deeplink`, `qrcode` are marked `required` in the schema; `cancel`/`refund`/
`checkout` are conditionally present per the description ("depends on the status of the
payment").

## Spec inconsistency to flag, not silently work around

Both `get_payment_response` and `merchant-callback` schemas list `totalAmount` in their
`required` array, but neither schema actually **defines** a `totalAmount` property — only
`amount`. This looks like a leftover from a prior field rename that the `required` array wasn't
updated for. **Don't model a `TotalAmount` property that doesn't exist** — treat `required` as
having a spec bug here, and only bind to the properties that are actually defined
(`amount`, not `totalAmount`). Worth flagging to devsupport, but not blocking.

## Confirmed: error codes (literal, from spec response descriptions)

**Payment API** (`POST /v3/payments`):
`400 BODY_MISSING | FIELD_IS_REQUIRED | FIELD_IS_INVALID`, `401 UNAUTHORIZED`,
`403 ACCESS_DENIED`, `404 MERCHANT_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`, `422 UNABLE_TO_PAY_CREDITOR`, `429`,
`500 TECHNICAL_ERROR`, `503 TRY_AGAIN_LATER`.

**Payment API** (`DELETE /v3/payments/{id}`):
`401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `403 ACCESS_DENIED | CALLER_NOT_ALLOWED_TO_CANCEL`,
`404 PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`, `422 PAYMENT_NOT_PENDING`, `429`, `500 TECHNICAL_ERROR`.

**Payment API** (`GET /v3/payments/{id}`): `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `403 ACCESS_DENIED`,
`404 PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`, `429`, `500`, `503`.

**Refund API** (`POST /v3/payments/{payment-id}/refunds`):
`422 PAYMENT_FOR_REFUND_NOT_FOUND | INVALID_REFUND_AMOUNT | REFUND_NOT_ALLOWED | REFUND_NOT_POSSIBLE | REFUND_REQUEST_CONFLICT`
(`REFUND_REQUEST_CONFLICT` = the `Idempotency-Key` was reused with different parameters), plus
generic `400`, `401`, `403`, `500`, `503`.

**Reconciliation API**: `400 BAD_REQUEST`, `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `403 ACCESS_DENIED`,
`404 PAYOUT_NOT_FOUND` (payments/refunds endpoints only), `500 TECHNICAL_ERROR`, `503`.

**Correction (2026-09-17, re-verified against the raw Refund/Reconciliation specs directly):**
the error shape is *not* identical across all three APIs as originally stated here. Only the
Payment API's `ErrorResponse` schema has `{ code, message, traceId, spanId }` (all four
required). The Refund and Reconciliation specs' own `ErrorResponse` schemas define only
`{ code, message }` — `traceId`/`spanId` aren't in those schemas at all, not just optional.
Model `TraceId`/`SpanId` as nullable and don't assume they'll be populated outside the Payment
API.

## Confirmed: Refund API schema (resolves v1's biggest unknown)

`POST /v3/payments/{payment-id}/refunds`, headers: `Idempotency-Key` (required, ≤64 chars) plus
the usual `Signature`.

Request body — **`amount` is required**, i.e. **partial refunds are supported by specifying any
amount**, not just a full-refund toggle:
```json
{ "amount": 1000, "currency": "EUR", "description": "optional, refund description" }
```
`amount`: int64 cents, 1–999,999,999,999 (same bounds as payment amount — no refund-specific cap
found in the spec; over-refund is presumably caught at runtime as `422 INVALID_REFUND_AMOUNT`).
No time-window field exists in the spec — if a window is enforced, it's a runtime business rule
surfaced via `REFUND_NOT_POSSIBLE`/`REFUND_NOT_ALLOWED`, not something to validate client-side.

Response (`RefundCreationResponse`, on `201`): `{ refundId, paymentId, status: "PENDING" (fixed one-value enum, matches the create-payment pattern), amount, currency, description?, creationDate }`.

`GET /v3/payments/{payment-id}/refunds/{refund-id}` response (`RefundModel`) is the same shape
but `status` is the **real** 3-value enum: `PENDING | REFUNDED | FAILED` (not `SUCCEEDED` —
v1 had this right, differs from the payment status enum's `SUCCEEDED`). `PROCESSING` and
`DEBTOR_IBAN_NOT_AVAILABLE` are indeed absent, confirming v1's changelog note.

## Confirmed: Reconciliation API schema

Matches v1 closely; a few exact field names confirmed from the raw spec:

- `GET /v3/reconciliation/payouts?date&size&page` → `{ size, totalPages, totalElements, number, payouts: [{ payoutId, merchantId, bulkId, iban, payoutStatus: SUCCEEDED|FAILED, payoutDate, payoutCurrency, totalPayments, totalRefunds, totalPaymentAmount, totalRefundAmount, payoutAmount }] }`
- `GET /v3/reconciliation/payments?payout-id|start-date&end-date&size&page` (max 30-day range) → `payments: [{ paymentId, paymentProfileId, merchantName, paymentChannel: ONLINE|INSTORE|INVOICE, currency, amount, reference?, description?, transactionDate }]`
- `GET /v3/reconciliation/refunds` — same as payments plus `refundId`.
- `size` default/max both 10000, `page` default 0 (zero-based) — matches v1.
- Same `Signature` header/JWS scheme as Payment/Refund (scheme name `JWS-Request-Signature` here, no suffix — same conflation as before, actual header is still `Signature`).

## Still open / not resolvable from the spec alone

- The `iss` claim discrepancy (Payment/Refund hardcode `"Payconiq"`, Reconciliation templates
  `"{Merchant Id}"`) — needs a direct question to devsupport, can't be resolved from docs alone.
- ~~Whether `/v3/payments/pos` (static QR / in-person) is in scope for this wrapper~~ —
  **resolved 2026-09-17: in scope.** The merchant's preprod onboarding request explicitly
  selected Static QR as one of its integration types, so this isn't hypothetical for this
  project, and the "wrap what the API exposes" scoping principle applies as normal.
- ~~No test-card/sandbox-simulation details surfaced in any of the fetched pages~~ — **resolved
  2026-09-17**, see the "Prose guides" section below. Test cards and app setup don't require
  preprod credentials to find; they were just on a page not fetched until now.
- **Discovered, not yet acted on (2026-09-17):** every 2xx/4xx response from the Reconciliation
  API declares its own `Signature` response header — Bancontact signs its own reconciliation
  responses, the same detached-JWS scheme used elsewhere. Neither the Payment nor Refund specs
  do this for ordinary (non-callback) responses. Not verified by `ReconciliationClient` —
  out of scope for that issue and not requested — but worth a follow-up issue if
  defense-in-depth response verification is ever wanted, since the machinery from the callback verification
  (JWKS client + `BancontactSignatureVerifier`) would mostly carry over.
- ~~Every prose guide page carries a "New payment URLs" banner with no specifics~~ — **resolved
  2026-09-17**, see "Payconiq→Bancontact Pro URL migration" below. The dedicated page wasn't in
  the navbar list originally captured; the user found it directly.

## Prose guides: real URLs confirmed, and what they add (2026-09-17)

Earlier passes referenced "the getting-started guide," "the callback guide," etc. without exact
URLs (summarized secondhand, not fetched directly). Confirmed real URLs by fetching
`https://docs.bancontactpro.com/` and its `.md` sibling and reading the actual navigation:

- [Getting Started](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/gettingstarted052025v4)
- [Callback Guide](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/callback052025)
- [Errors, statuses and responses](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/errorsandstatuses052025)
- [On a Display](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/instore/ondisplay052025v4)
- [On a Receipt](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/instore/receipt052025v4)
- [Static QR](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/instore/staticqr052025v4)
- [Top Up](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/online/topup052025v4)
- [Invoice](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/invoice/invoice052025v4)
- [Online Sales](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/online/onlinesales) (see below —
  discontinued)
- [Refunds](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/refunds052025)
- [Reconciliation](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/reconciliation052025)
- [Payout & remittance](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/payoutremittance052025)
- [Brand guidelines](https://brand.bancontactpro.com/) (separate site)

Each page is fetchable as raw markdown by appending `.md` to its URL — much more reliable to
parse than the rendered SPA (same lesson as [[research-verify-against-raw-spec]], now confirmed
to apply to the prose guides too, not just the OpenAPI JSON).

**Significant finding — Online Sales *and* Invoice appear discontinued.** Both guides carry the
identical banner: *"Please note that this payment solution is no longer offered directly by
Bancontact [Payconiq] Company. If you would still like to use a similar solution in your
business please contact one of the partners listed here."* None of the four guides for the
products the merchant actually onboarded for (On a Display, On a Receipt, Static QR, Top Up)
carry this notice. The merchant's actual preprod onboarding request
([[project-merchant-entity-type]]) matches those four, not Online Sales/Invoice — so this isn't
a hypothetical concern for this project; the README and getting-started.md have been reframed
accordingly (2026-09-17) to lead with the in-store products. The underlying `IPaymentClient`
operations are unaffected — On a Display's implementation guide confirms it uses the exact same
`POST/GET/DELETE /v3/payments*` operations as Online Sales, just under a different product/PPID
configuration.

**Payment validity window is per-product, not a spec constant.** The OpenAPI spec doesn't state
an expiry at all. On a Display's guide states **2 minutes (120 seconds)**; Online Sales' guide
stated **20 minutes (1200 seconds)** — the "20 minutes" figure previously in this project's docs
came from the Online Sales guide specifically and has been corrected. Don't hardcode either
value; it's merchant-profile configuration, not something derivable from the API responses
themselves.

**Test cards and pre-production app setup found** (Getting Started guide) — previously flagged
in this document as unresolvable without credentials, but it turns out this was just on a page
not yet fetched:

| Issuer | Card Number | Expiry | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| KBC | `5127 8829 9999 9715` | Nov-29 | Always authorized |
| KBC | `5127 8829 9999 9723` | Nov-29 | Insufficient funds |
| KBC | `5127 8829 9999 9731` | Nov-29 | Card refused by issuer |

Pre-production Bancontact Pay app build: [download form](https://tally.so/r/nP8P1Q) (separate
from the production App Store/Play Store build — installing both causes redirection issues).
In-app onboarding uses fixed placeholder codes (`123456` for both email and phone verification,
no real OTP sent) — this is by design for the test environment, not a bug to route around.

**JWKS caching guidance confirmed** (Callback Guide) — matches this project's `JwksClient`
design (refresh-on-miss) without requiring a code change: Bancontact recommends caching JWKS for
up to **12 hours** and re-fetching on verification failure; a new JWK is added **24 hours**
before the old one is removed, giving a rotation overlap window. The callback guide's JOSE
header example also independently confirms the exact claim shape already documented above
(`crit` array, `https://payconiq.com/{sub,iss,iat,jti,path}`), and is the actual source of the
`PENDING_MERCHANT_AKNOWLEDGMENT` misspelling flagged earlier in this document — the errors-and-
statuses guide spells it that way in prose (`AKNOWLEDGMENT`), while the real OpenAPI enum is
`ACKNOWLEDGEMENT`. Confirmed the misspelling's exact source, not just its existence.

## Payconiq→Bancontact Pro URL migration — confirmed details (2026-09-17)

The dedicated migration page,
[Payment link update](https://docs.bancontactpro.com/guides/general/payloadurlupdate) (not
linked from the navbar the sidebar scrape captured — found by directly guessing/being given the
slug), gives the actual old→new URL table the generic per-page banners never specified:

| Impacted URL | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `_links.qrcode.href`'s embedded `c=` target | `https://payconiq.com/pay/2/{transactionId}` | `https://pay.bancontact.net/pay/2/{transactionId}` |
| `_links.deeplink.href` | `https://payconiq.com/pay/2/{transactionId}` | `https://pay.bancontact.net/pay/2/{transactionId}` |
| `_links.checkout.href` | `https://checkout.bancontact.net/?...` | `https://pay.bancontact.net/?...` |
| Static QR / On a Receipt / Top Up / Invoice payload URLs | `https://payconiq.com/t/1/{PPID}?D=...&A=...&R=...` | `https://pay.bancontact.net/t/1/{PPID}?D=...&A=...&R=...` |

The QR-code-image generator host itself (`https://qrcodegenerator.api.bancontact.net/qrcode?...`,
production; preprod has its own, see below)
is **not** changing — only the `c=` payload URL embedded inside it. Live in pre-production, and in
production **from 11 May 2026**. Printed QR codes using the old `payconiq.com` URLs stayed valid
**until 15 June 2026**; that date has passed, so old-domain codes may have stopped working, which
matters for anything physically printed (Static QR at a till, On a Receipt).

**Dates on that page are written dd/mm/yyyy** ("released in production from 11/05/2026", "valid
until 15/06/2026"; the 15 can only be a day). An earlier version of these notes read the first as
mm/dd and recorded 5 November 2026; corrected 2026-10-16 against the page itself.

**Quirk to remember**: for the time being, URLs the *API itself* returns in pre-production use
`pay.acc.bancontact.net`, not the `pay.preprod.bancontact.net` pattern you'd expect by analogy
with `merchant.api.preprod.bancontact.net` — don't assume a consistent `*.preprod.*` naming
convention across every Bancontact hostname.

**This also resolves a real functionality gap this project hadn't addressed**: On a Receipt,
Top Up, and (had it not been discontinued) Invoice never call a REST endpoint to create their
QR code at all — the merchant builds the QR/deeplink payload URL entirely client-side by
templating `{host}/t/1/{PPID}?D={description}&A={amountCents}&R={reference}`, then wraps that in
the QR-image-generator URL. Static QR is subtly different again: the *printed* QR code is a
one-time "location" link, `{host}/l/1/{PPID}/{POSId}` (no amount at all) — the per-transaction
amount is attached separately via the already-implemented `POST /v3/payments/pos` call
(`CreateStaticQrPaymentAsync`), which explains why creating a new static-QR payment for the same
`posId` invalidates the previous one (see docs/architecture.md's spec-quirks list): the printed
QR's link never changes, only which pending payment it currently resolves to. None of this is in
any of the three OpenAPI specs (it's pure URL templating, not an HTTP call), so it was invisible
to the "verify against the raw spec" pass that scoped the first implementation issues — it only surfaced once the
prose guides for the specific products actually onboarded for were read end-to-end. Tracked as a
new feature: see `BancontactPro.QrCodes.PaymentLinkBuilder`.

### Preprod hosts for self-built payload URLs (2026-10-16)

**What the docs say.** Read again: the Payment link update page and the On a Receipt, Top Up,
Static QR, Invoice, On a Display and Getting started guides (their `.md` sources).

- None of them gives a preprod host for the self-built `/t/1/{PPID}` or `/l/1/{PPID}/{POSId}`
  payload URLs, or a preprod QR code generator. Every payload and generator example uses the
  production hosts (`pay.bancontact.net`, or still `payconiq.com` on the Top Up and Static QR
  pages, and `qrcodegenerator.api.bancontact.net`).
- The only preprod pay host they name is in the migration page's note that the URLs *sent by the
  API* in pre-production all use `pay.acc.bancontact.net` (the page misspells it
  "banconcat") and not `pay.preprod.bancontact.net`. It is silent on URLs the merchant builds.
- The only preprod host stated anywhere else is the Merchant API's,
  `merchant.api.preprod.bancontact.net`.

**What preprod itself shows.**

- A real preprod create-payment response (2026-10-15) had `_links.deeplink` on
  `pay.acc.bancontact.net` and `_links.qrcode` on `qrcodegenerator.api.preprod.bancontact.net`.
- Unauthenticated GETs to the QR generators (2026-10-16):
  - The preprod generator renders `pay.acc.bancontact.net` payloads for `/t/1/...`, `/l/1/...`
    and `/pay/2/...`. It also renders `pay.bancontact.net` and `payconiq.com` payloads, but
    answers 400 for a `pay.preprod.bancontact.net` payload.
  - The production generator answers 400 for a `pay.acc.bancontact.net` payload.
  - So the generators check the payload's host against a list, and `pay.acc` is on preprod's list
    only. The old builder's production pair rendered fine but pointed the payer at production.
- The `pay.*` hosts return the same 637-byte HTML shell for any path, including made-up ones and
  `pay.preprod.bancontact.net`, so requesting a payload URL proves nothing about it.

**What the library does.** `PaymentLinkBuilder` takes a `BancontactEnvironment` and builds
`pay.acc.bancontact.net` plus `qrcodegenerator.api.preprod.bancontact.net` for `Preprod`, and the
documented production hosts for `Production`.

**Not yet verified:** that the preprod Bancontact Pay app opens a self-built
`pay.acc.bancontact.net/t/1/{PPID}` or `/l/1/{PPID}/{POSId}` QR code for a real preprod PPID.
Scanning one with the preprod app settles it. If it fails, ask devsupport which host self-built
preprod payloads should use.

### What Bancontact Pro is

A rebrand of the former Payconiq platform. Product lineup centers on QR/bank-app payments
across four categories: On a Display, On a Receipt, Static QR, and Top Up (a closed-loop
card/wristband credit system). A genuine online/e-commerce flow exists separately (see below)
— not just the in-person QR products.

### Online payment flow

1. Merchant backend `POST`s to create a payment.
2. Customer is redirected to Bancontact's hosted checkout page, **or** the merchant renders
   its own checkout using the returned QR-code URL directly.
3. Customer confirms in their banking app.
4. Bancontact sends an asynchronous webhook to the merchant's `CallbackUrl` with status
   `PENDING` / `AUTHORIZED` / `FAILED`.
5. Customer is redirected back to the merchant's `ReturnUrl`.

**Callback/redirect ordering is not guaranteed** — the docs explicitly call this out, which is
why `GET /v3/payments/{id}` exists as a required fallback, not an optional nicety.

### Onboarding

Not self-serve. Production: apply via the merchant portal. Pre-production (sandbox): email
[devsupport@bancontact.com](mailto:devsupport@bancontact.com) with company name, Merchant ID,
and contact details — **up to two weeks** turnaround. No test-card/QR-simulation details were
found in the docs excerpts
gathered so far.

### Why build this as a separate library rather than inline in a consuming app

Mirrors the [`Eventbrite.Net`](https://github.com/DeWall88/Eventbrite.Net) pattern: a
general-purpose, non-app-specific API client (including the JWS signing/verification, which is
genuinely reusable logic) belongs in its own package, consumed via `PackageReference` by
whatever application needs it — not duplicated inline.

This library wraps the Bancontact Pro API as-is: it exposes what the API exposes, scoped to the
operations the raw OpenAPI specs define, not a curated subset or an opinionated redesign on top.

### Alternative considered

If *Bancontact the payment method* (rather than *Bancontact Pro the platform specifically*) is
ever the actual requirement, [Mollie](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mollie.Api) has a mature
official .NET SDK with Bancontact support and a meaningfully simpler auth model (bearer key +
webhook secret, no JWS/JWKS). Noted here as a known trade-off, not a recommendation to switch.

**Not an option for every merchant**: Mollie doesn't onboard Belgian *feitelijke verenigingen*
(unincorporated associations); Bancontact Pro does. For such a merchant the simpler auth model
above is moot — Mollie is never a real alternative, regardless of the JWS/JWKS complexity
trade-off.
